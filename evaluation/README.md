For this evaluation to work you need to have the same set up for Pike Bot as in other cases and additional setup of Maia chess described in https://lczero.org/play/quickstart/. 
We also use a list of openings from https://en.chessbase.com/post/test-your-engines-the-silver-openings-suite. Saved in evaluation/games/silversuite.pgn.
We also use a set of games generated by using stockfish, few first moves were chosen from the best suggested by the engine, then few next moves were generated by choosing a move closest to the provided offset in example games in evaluation/games/bias-openings_-2.pgn should all end as close as possible to a position evaluated at -2 from white's perspective. 

To set up your own experiment specify two engine models in the beginning of evaluation/evaluate_engines.ipynb as well a as list of datasets you wish to evaluate. Then run the whole notebook. A result of the operation can be found under results in the file named after the both engines, dataset name and a timestamp of creation.
