# Pretrained

This directory should hold models used for transfer learning. Currently Lela and Maia models are all stored here, but to the repo I am only sending one of the models for the sake of clarity, to explain the format in which the models are stored.
The models can be found here: <br>
Lela: https://lczero.org/play/networks/bestnets/ <br>
Maia: https://github.com/CSSLab/maia-chess/tree/master/maia_weights <br>
