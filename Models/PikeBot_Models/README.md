# PikeBot_Models

This directory holds already saved and trained models. IS has been placed in the repo only for the sake of visualization, at least fo now. We can later add the final model here.
The models themselves should be saved as {model_name}_weights.h5 for weights and {model_name}_architecture.json. Later the files can be saed as a .pb format for the sake of storing them here.
