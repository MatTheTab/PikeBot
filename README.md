# PikeBot
Repository for an AI-based chess bot designed to exploit human gameplay weaknesses, set up traps, and play much more aggressively than the vast majority of the currently available chess bots.
PikeBot utilizes score evaluations generated by Stockfish to make intelligent, human-like decisions, resulting in more dynamic and exciting chess games. 
What sets PikeBot apart from other chess bots is its commitment to utilizing human strategic weaknesses rather than pursuing optimal gameplay, leading to more engaging gameplay.
